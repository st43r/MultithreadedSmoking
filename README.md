# Smokers Problem

This program simulates the Smokers Problem, where three smokers and a bartender interact according to specific rules. Smokers can smoke cigarettes if all the necessary components are on the table. The bartender randomly selects two smokers and places their components on the table.

## Description

- **Smokers:** Each of the three smokers has an infinite supply of one of three components: tobacco, paper, or matches.
- **Bartender:** Each turn, the bartender selects two smokers and places their components on the table.
- **Smoking:** The third smoker, who has the missing component, takes all the components from the table, rolls a cigarette, and starts smoking.
